"""AI-powered failure diagnosis engine (Scenario 3).

Analyzes test failures using Gemini LLM to determine:
  1. Root cause category: test_design, application_bug, or environment
  2. Detailed explanation of what went wrong
  3. Actionable fix — either improved test steps or application fix suggestions

The analyzer receives the full failure context (error message, page state,
available elements, test steps, expected outcome) and returns a structured
diagnosis that the UI can render with clear next steps.

- Links: {json.dumps(available_elements.get('links', [])[:10])}

ORIGINAL TEST STEPS:
{test_steps}

EXPECTED OUTCOME: {expected_outcome}

TASK: Classify the failure into ONE of these categories and provide actionable advice.

Categories:
1. "test_design" — The test steps are incorrect, incomplete, or reference elements that don't match the actual UI. For example: wrong button name, missing a prerequisite step, wrong field name, incorrect expected outcome.
2. "application_bug" — The application itself has a problem. The test steps are reasonable but the app is not functioning correctly. For example: error messages on page, broken functionality, server errors, unexpected behavior.
3. "environment" — Something outside both the test and app caused the failure. For example: network timeout, browser crash, service unavailable, DNS failure, port not reachable.

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

  "explanation": "2-3 sentences explaining the root cause in detail",
