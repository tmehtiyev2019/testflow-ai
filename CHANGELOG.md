## [prototype-1] - 2026-02-13

### Implemented (Deliverable 2)
- **Scenario 1 Prototype (Test Creation):** Added an in-memory platform prototype that supports login, navigation to "Create Test", saving a test scenario, and listing tests with default status **"Not Run"**.
- Implemented Behave step definitions for **Scenario 1** in `acceptance_tests/test_creation.feature` using the prototype.

### Changed
- Improved Behave environment output so scenarios that error/fail are not printed as "PASSED".

### Notes
- Only Scenario 1 is implemented in this deliverable. Other scenarios remain stubs.
